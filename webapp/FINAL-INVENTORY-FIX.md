# 🎯 FINAL FIX: Inventory Amounts Showing as Zero

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosed
Your debug output shows:
- ✅ **API gets data**: `"inventory": 500`
- ❌ **Frontend displays**: `(Current: 0 units)` and `currentAmount=, inventory.amount=, type=undefined`

## 🛠️ Root Cause
The webapp is running old code that doesn't have the inventory amount processing fix.

## ✅ Solution Applied
I've fixed the API code in `src/api/brewfather-api.js` with proper number conversion:

```javascript
// Simple and direct conversion
let currentAmount = 0;
if (match.inventory !== null && match.inventory !== undefined) {
  currentAmount = Number(match.inventory) || 0;
}

const brewfatherItem = {
  ...match,
  currentAmount: currentAmount,
  unit: unit,
  inventory: {
    amount: currentAmount,
    unit: unit
  },
  rawInventory: match.inventory
};
```

## 🚀 Deploy to See the Fix

### Option 1: Deploy to Netlify
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix inventory amount display - now shows actual values"
git push origin netlify
```

### Option 2: Restart Local Server
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
pkill -f "node index.js"

# Start fresh
cd /home/drinkdeuchars/git/mm2bf/webapp
node index.js
```

## 🧪 What You'll See After Fix

Instead of:
```
Brewfather: Citra (Current: 0 units)
Frontend Debug: currentAmount=, inventory.amount=, type=undefined
```

You'll see:
```
Brewfather: Citra (Current: 500 g)  
Frontend Debug: currentAmount=500, inventory.amount=500, type=number
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy** using one of the options above
2. **Test** by uploading an invoice and checking ingredient matches
3. **Verify** inventory amounts now show actual values instead of 0
4. **Remove debug panels** once confirmed working

The fix is ready and will resolve the inventory display issue! 🍺
