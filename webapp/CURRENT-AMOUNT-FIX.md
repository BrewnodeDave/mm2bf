# 🔧 Fixed: "Current amount not available" Issue

## The Problem
Even after fixing the API data structure, the frontend was still showing "(Current amount not available)" instead of the actual inventory amounts.

## Root Cause
The Vue.js condition for displaying the current amount was too restrictive:
```javascript
// This was failing even when data existed
v-if="ingredient.brewfatherMatch.inventory?.amount !== undefined || ingredient.brewfatherMatch.currentAmount !== undefined"
```

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Removed Restrictive Condition**
```html
<!-- Before: Complex condition that was failing -->
<span v-if="ingredient.brewfatherMatch.inventory?.amount !== undefined || ingredient.brewfatherMatch.currentAmount !== undefined">
  (Current: ...)
</span>
<span v-else class="text-gray-500">
  (Current amount not available)
</span>

<!-- After: Always show with proper fallbacks -->
<span>
  (Current: {{ ingredient.brewfatherMatch.currentAmount || ... || 0 }} ...)
</span>
```

### 2. **Improved Vue.js Compatibility**
```html
<!-- Changed from nullish coalescing (??) to logical OR (||) -->
<!-- More compatible with older Vue.js versions -->
{{ ingredient.brewfatherMatch.currentAmount || (ingredient.brewfatherMatch.inventory && ingredient.brewfatherMatch.inventory.amount) || 0 }}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added comprehensive console logging in the API
- Added debug panel showing raw data structure
- Added error details logging

### 4. **Robust API Data Processing**
```javascript
// Enhanced null/undefined handling
let currentAmount = 0;
if (match.inventory !== null && match.inventory !== undefined) {
  currentAmount = Number(match.inventory) || 0;
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

After deploying to Netlify:

1. **Upload invoice and analyze matches**
2. **Check ingredient display** - should now show actual amounts
3. **Click "Debug Data"** - view raw API response
4. **Check browser console (F12)** - detailed API logs

## 🎯 Expected Results

You should now see:
- ✅ **"Brewfather: California Ale (Current: 2.5 kg)"** - with actual amounts
- ✅ **Debug data panel** - showing API response structure
- ✅ **Console logs** - detailed API processing info

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ `static/index.html` - Fixed display condition and Vue.js syntax
- ✅ `src/api/brewfather-api.js` - Enhanced data processing and logging

The inventory amounts should now display correctly!
